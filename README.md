### Document Understanding Model Documentation

### Introduction

This document outlines the architecture, training, evaluation, and usage of a document understanding model built upon the LayoutLMv2 framework. The model aims to extract meaningful information from unstructured documents, such as PDFs, and images.

### Target Audience

- **Businesses:** Utilize the model for automating data extraction from documents like invoices, contracts, and reports.
- **Individuals:** Benefit from organizing personal documents and extracting key information.
- **Developers:** Integrate the model into applications for document processing tasks.

### Model Architecture

The model comprises several interconnected components:

- **Preprocessing:** Handles document conversion, cleaning, and normalization.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant features from document content, including textual, visual, and layout features.
- **Model Core:** Employs a LayoutLMv2 model for encoding document information.
- **Post-processing:** Refines model outputs and converts them into desired formats.

### Model Training

- **Dataset:** The FUNSD dataset is used for training, providing document images, text, bounding boxes, and NER tags.
- **Training Process:** The LayoutLMv2 model is trained end-to-end using the AdamW optimizer and cross-entropy loss.

### Model Performance

The model demonstrates strong performance on the FUNSD dataset, achieving high accuracy in named entity recognition and document understanding tasks.

### Usage

**Note**: 
1. It is recommended to explore this notebook in google colab or kaggle.
2. To reduce the risk of conflicting dependencies, run the notebook as it is

- **Input:** The model accepts document images as input.
- **Output:** The model produces structured output, including extracted text, bounding boxes, NER tags, and potentially document-level classifications.
- **Code Example:** (Provide a code snippet demonstrating how to use the model)

### Limitations

The model may struggle with complex document layouts, low-quality images, and domain-specific terminology.

### Future Work

Future improvements include incorporating advanced layout analysis techniques, exploring different model architectures, and expanding the model's capabilities to handle a wider range of document types.
